Hi I'm paul@pauls1evans.plus.com (when I am able to read my mail) I am being relentlessly hacked for over a year I am 67 years old and have ASD
Just started getting into computers for a maths degree when this all kicked off. Well four new computers down 9 hard drives 21 usb drives and I have just been hacked again.
I have just spent another £600 for an untangle system with support- well they bricked it before I could go on line. I am not computer savvy but I am trying.I am sure these hackers in bluetooth
in bluetooyh range are leaving lots of forensic network evidence with these attacks but I need help and I will pay for people in the community to help me (I dont know who to trust) just to be able to stay on line long enough
to learn more. I believe That third parties from inside the telecoms industry are involved. I am a genuine guy all my stuff is legit and inoquous. My whole family have been shut down! Everything is hacked !
They will not beat me or rather I will not give up! Even if this is intercepted by "the Man in the middle" I came to GitHub to get the code for an Arduino project for a mic -jammer
after following a brilliant demo by justan enginneer 1976 (my memory is bad on you tube .) JUst lost the code and everything on the other computer again. Anyway back to soldering.
Open source is absolutely brilliant and I will give support as much as I can. All the best - PAUL
